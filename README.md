Overview
--------

Nash-Cipher is a "toy" implementation of the cipher described by
[John Nash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.) in his
letters to the NSA in 1955. These letters have been declassified by the NSA and
published on their website in January 2012. For more information, read the
[press release](http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2012/nash_exhibit.shtml).
If you are interested in cryptography, you should definitely read these letters.
